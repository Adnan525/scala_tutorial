- "Extends App": Means the class or code between curly braces is executable, BASICALLY THE MAIN METHOD  
- Type mentioning is optional.  
- Interpolated String = s"_______________", same as python f string
- Expressions : structures that can be reduced to a value.  
- A codeblock has to return something.
- Functions are usually recursive.  
- In scala, don't use loops or iteration, use recursion.  
- Unit is type of side effects.
- Use Immutatble objects, any modification will return a new object
- Scala is closest to OOP
- The App class already has static main(args : Array[String]) so eqv. to java main
  

In scala we have class, instance, inheritance, polymorphism, abstract class.  
Class definition is also constructor.  
Have to use val in class definition to make it a field.  
In subtype polymorphism, the most derived method is called.
